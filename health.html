			<p>Like humans, exercise is a very important thing to keep guinea pigs healthy. If they do not get proper exercise, what happens to them is basically what happens to us when we don't exercise. Most people exercise their guinea pigs by letting them have floor time in an enclosed corner of a room where they have a lot of space to explore and run around. Some exercise can include outdoor time, but then even more precautions will have to be made to prevent escaping or other unknown dangers.</p>
