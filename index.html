		<p class="right">Guinea pigs are curious little critters, characterized by their short little legs, petal shaped ears and short to long hair. Their life expectancy is 4-8 years, but can vary depending on the living conditions and the family history among other factors. Guinea pigs are great for anyone any age! The only factor to consider is if you are allowing a younger child handle a guinea pig, they must be supervised as a guinea pigs bones are very fragile and may break because they are being held too tightly or too loosely and dropped.</p>
